# UNet-PyTorch
My final attempt and implementation of the UNet architecture. 

Inspired by the model architecute diagram given at https://pytorch.org/hub/mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet/, but made to fit for images of (3, 512, 512) size.

Note: generalized architecture with customizable input sizes coming soon!
